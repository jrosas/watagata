If the Beatles Were Computer Geeks

Sing along...
Yesterday

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,

Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,

Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.

And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.

And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,

Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.

And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,

Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.

And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.

I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.

What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,

Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.

Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics
Write in C.
If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.

If you have just spent nearly 30 hours,
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, yeah, Write in C.
BASIC is not the answer.
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
Pascal won not quite cut it.
Write in C.

Yesterday,
All those backups seemed a waste of pay.
Now my database has gone away.
Oh I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly,
There is not half the files there used to be,
And there is a milestone hanging over me.
The system crashed so suddenly.
I pushed something wrong
What it was I could not say.

Now all my data is gone
and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.

Yesterday,
The need for back-ups seemed so far away.
I knew my data was all here to stay,
Now I believe in yesterday.
Write in C

To The Tune of "Let It Be"

When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom
Write in C.
As the deadline fast approaches,
And bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers
Write in C.
Write in C, Write in C,
Write in C, oh, Write in C.
LOGO is dead and buried,
Write in C.
I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
